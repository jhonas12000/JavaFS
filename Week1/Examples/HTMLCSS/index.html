    <!-- div tags are just the way to group tags together and it is used for organization-->
    <div>
        Divs are generic block elements that are used to separate a section in an HTML document
        <div>
            You can add more nested divs as much as you want!
            They are divs within divs
        </div>
        <p> Paragraphs are design to display long texts in your website and it is more so to help developers
            understand what is the purpose of this specific section of your website
        </p>

        <h3>Span Tag</h3>
        <span>This is used to create inline elements</span>
        <span>This is another span</span>

    <h3> Be careful of how you structure your HTML</h3>
    <div>
        <span>Will this be inline?</span>
        <span>Another span</span>
    </div>
    <div>
        <span>Or not?</span>

        <h2>Article Tag</h2>
        <p>This is an article tag. It is used to group content that makes up an article or a section of a website.
            It is more specific than a div tag and it helps developers understand what the purpose of this section is.

    <h3>Introduction to CSS</h3>
    <!--CSS Specificity
      * This will determine what style should apply to a particular element(s) because sometimes
      stylings conflict with each other
      * General Rule:
        1. Inline Styles (inside an element) - most specific will have highest priority
        2. ID selector - will have high priority
        3. class selector - will have second priority
        4. element selector - least specific will have lowest priority
